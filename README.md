# Spring Hocon PropertySourceLoader

Project aims to add support for HOCON format in spring boot configuration files.
YAML is great, but some people prefer HOCON more so it's good to have a choice.

There are 2 modules:

1. spring-hocon-property-source - contains property source loader itself
2. hocon-property-example - contains simple spring-boot-starter-web project with demonstration
of hocon configuration

# How to use it in my spring boot code?

**Version 0.4 is aimed for SpringBoot 2.2. For 1.x check version 0.1**

1. Add a dependency to your maven project

        <dependency>
              <groupId>com.github.zeldigas</groupId>
              <artifactId>spring-hocon-property-source</artifactId>
              <version>0.4.0</version>
        </dependency>

2. Place your HOCON configuration to *.conf files
3. Enjoy!

Alternatively you can use `@HoconPropertySource("my-hocon.conf")` annotation to load 
specific file on classpath just like you can do with `@PropertySource` annotation for
`*.properties` files.
